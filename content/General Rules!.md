# Rolling!

All important things in Cortex have die ratings from d4 to d12. When rolling, you (or me) will create a pool from 3 to INFINITY dice and roll them. Then, you pick any two dice and add them together to act as your total

Example:
> I'm trying to scale a wall. I gather my dice by looking at the stats on my character sheet. When rolling a d10, d8, d6, I get a result of 5, 2 and 4. I pick 5 and 4, adding them together for a total of 9!

The other, defending side then rolls their dice and picks a total. To succeed, they need to ***beat*** your total. Difficulty of tasks is set in two dice if there is no opponent 

![[Pasted image 20250603011926.png|500]]

> The wall I'm scaling is not too high, so kind and omnipotent GM sets the difficulty to d6, d6. They roll, getting 3 and 4 for a total of 7. I succeed!

# The Effect Die
After picking your total, you also pick another die - the Effect Die. The Effect Die determines how potent what you did was, with d4 being a questionable victory and d12 being some amazing shit. If you hit someone with a stick, your Total determines if you hit while your Effect Die determines the damage.

When picking the Effect Die, the rolled number is not relevant - only the size of the die. d8 that rolled a 2 and a d8 that rolled an 8 are absolutely the same when picking them as Effect Dice. 

>In the example above, I picked the d10 and d6 for my total, leaving the d8 as the effect die. Which means I will scale the wall promptly and quickly, without much problems

If your Total exceeds the enemy Total by 5 or more, you raise your effect die by one "step"

# Parts of your Character

Your character will be comprised of Sets - lists of words/statements with dice values called Traits. When a Trait is applicable to your action, you add it to your dice pool. Best example of a Set is Attribute or Skill list from DnD

>I'm trying to lift a heavy rock, so I am definitely adding my d8 Physical attribute to the pool
## Prime Sets
Prime Sets are Sets that you will include in every single roll you make - remember how I said before that you roll from 3 to Infinity dice? Those minimum 3 are coming from Prime Sets. All characters will have those.

### Attributes
For this setting, you will have 3 Attributes: 

- Physical
- Mental
- Social

Each starts with a `d8`. You can lower one stat by a step to raise the other stat by a step. Here is what each die rating signifies:

![[Pasted image 20250603013634.png|400]] 


### Professions
These Traits represent the experience your character has. Each takes on a form of "\[Type of Work\] in \[Social Circle\]. You will start with 3 but can get more. One Profession will have a rating of d10, another of d8 and last one - d6. If you are doing a roll, but don't have a profession that would make sense, roll a d4

Example Professions:
- Assassin of the Ice Serpents
- Doctor from St. Angels Hospital
- Diplomat from a Faraway Land
- Charmer from the Green Stacks

### Distinctions
These Traits represent unique things about your character!  They are 3 Traits, all with a d8 value, taking on a form of short, ~3-4 word long phrases or quotes about your character. Those are the things that will basically be included in your every roll and will color your actions a lot, so make sure to include the defining characteristics of your silly little guy in here

Examples:
- Lone Wanderer
- "I never miss"
- A people person
- Curiosity will kill this cat
- Fox That Never Shuts Up

Distinctions also often are the things where SFX are attached to. SFX (Special Effects) are basically special abilities that have an upside and a downside (or a specific requirement). SFX are designed together with the GM


> [!NOTE] Everything has distinctions!
> Most often than not Places, Enemies, difficult obstacles and other NPCs will have their own distinctions. The neat part is that you can use those in your favor (except enemies, but it *will* step their Distinction dice to d4)!


All distinctions have a SFX called Hinder by default: if you feel like your Distinction will hurt you in a moment or you feel none are appropriate for the situation, you can change its value to d4 for a roll to get a point of Fate (more on Fate later, it's sorta like Bennies)


## Non - Prime Sets
These sets will not be present for every character and you don't have to include them in all the rolls. You can skip on them until you are curious about em!

### Signature Gear
The game assumes that you have typical gear for your character. But what if you want something special? Something that's cool, shiny, breach-loaded and makes your shooting attempts all the better? This is what Signature Gear is for! It represents items and equipment that's special to your character. During character creation you will most likely only get d6 Signature Gear, but it can be upgraded to higher die values later on

### Relationships & Values
Some relationships are strong enough to impact your actions. Relationships are traits that represent that. They have a bit different structure from other Traits - in addition to name and dice value, Relationships also has a statement:
> d8 Alicia - I need to save her from herself

If you do an action that goes right against that statement, add x3 the dice to your pool, but erase the statement afterwards and "step down"  (reduce by one die size) the relationship. At the end of the session, write a new Statement for the relationship
#### Values
Some values can also be the what drives your character through hard times. They operate just like Relationships do.
Example: 
> d8 Justice - No person ever has to be able to decide the fate of others

> [!NOTE] Relationship & Value progression
> Characters are ever evolving. To represent that, at the end of a session you have an opportunity to evolve your Relationship or Value. You can either:
> - Create a new Relationship or Value at a d6 Rank
> - Change a statement on a Relationship or Value
> - Step up an existing Relationship or Value

### Specialties
These traits represent your characters narrow abilities at specific things, like fighting with knives or seducing dragons. Specialties need to be pretty specific like that - for reference, a Specialty needs to definitely be smaller than a DnD skill

### Resources
These traits represent a pool of influence/items/whatnot that give you an edge, but with limited uses. Resource trait takes a form of 2-3 dice of the same value with a name. Example:
> d8, d8 Armor-Piercing Ammo
> 
> d6, d6, d6 Contacts in the Admiralty

When using a Resource, you can roll one or several dice from the list - in the case above, I can roll either 1 or 2. Then, take the highest and add it to the roll Total as a third die. The dice that you have rolled can't be used again this session

### Powers
A power is a special kind of trait that represents superhuman ability or some extraordinary quality that most normal humans or baseline characters don’t have. The origin or source of powers varies from setting to setting radiation, genetic mutation, sorcery, high-tech gadgets, etc. Powers often have SFX attached to them! 

Main strength of Powers is not the dice per-se, but the narrative permissions that they give. If you have flight, you can, well, fly to attack the dragon instead of trying to jump or something like that

Examples:
> d6 Thermal Vision
> 
> d8 Invisibility
> 
> d12 Time Travel

# Assets and Complications

Not all traits are listed on a PC or GMC’s character file!
Some traits are temporary, reflecting conditions, circumstances, or objects that help (Assets) or that make things difficult (Complications). These, too, are given die ratings and are included in dice pools where appropriate.

Assets and Complications are things that you will often create with your actions or receive from failed rolls

Assets are most often short-lived, lasting only for a scene unless you players are willing to spend additional resources to keep them around; **d8 Hidden in the shadows** would be a good example of an Asset, as it signifies that your character picked a good hiding spot and you will not spend the rest of your days in that particular shadow. 

Complications are sticky and last until the PC has either overcome them or the complication is irrelevant. A **d10 Gunshot wound** is a prime example of a complication, but so is **d6 Humiliated** or **d6 Laying prone**. Complications are added to the dice pool of your *opposition* when rolling! 

So, in essence: **Assets are good, and they usually stick around for no longer than a scene. Complications are bad, and they usually need to be healed/removed to go away, although some can just disappear or step down at the end of every scene**
## Creating Assets and Complications

A lot of your rolls that don't just resolve a problem (one example of a roll that does would be, say, climbing over a wall) will create assets or complications for the enemy. In those cases the value of an Asset or a Complication is equal to the Effect Die


> [!NOTE] Limitations on Asset Size
> Sometimes, it just doesn't make sense to have an Assets for toilet paper you scrounged be a d12. In those cases, I can impose the maximum effect level. You can still use bigger dice for the effect die, just the asset will be of the maximum allowed size


## Removing Assets and Complications

Just like creating them, rolls may remove or step down Assets and Complications. You succeed at the roll, and if the Effect Die is equal or lower to the value of Asset/Complication, you step it down. If it's higher, you just remove the thing entirely

d8 Complication + d10 Effect = No complication

d8 Complication + d8 Effect = d6 Complication

## Making things Worse

Just like being removed, Assets and Complications can be upgraded! If your Effect is higher than the die of the Asset/Complication, Asset/Complication value is set to the Effect. If it's Equal/Lower, step it up one die size


> [!NOTE] A note on Defeat
> If your Complication is stepped up while at d12, you will be Taken Out, which means overwhelmed by that particular trouble and unable to act - too hurt, too stressed, too Wanted by Cops. This is *bad*, as the enemy gets to decide your fate and there will be consequences, at the very least resulting in a d6 Trauma - a pretty sticky Complication that requires specialised equipment/time/effort + a good roll to heal
> 
> Alternative to being Taken Out is Giving Up. At any point **while the dice are not being rolled**, you may declare that you are Giving Up. This removes you from the scene, but does not give Trauma and, even if you need to concede something, you exit on your terms and get a Fate (more on Fate soon)

## d4 Assets and Complications

Because rolling a d4 is pretty bad (more on why later), if you have a d4 Complication, it is added to *your* roll instead, and a d4 Asset is added to the roll of your opposition. 

d4 Assets/Complications are so meek that they don't survive being rolled - if the roll that you use em in doesn't step them up, they are gone right after
# Fate 

Fate, or, if you look in the rulebook, Plot Points (abbreviated as PP) is the metacurrency of the game. You start with 3 points at the beginning of every session (subject to change), regardless of how many you had before, so **use em**. I start with 2 (one for each of you, my beloved dumbasses) to use on NPCs

What are points of Fate used on:
- Activate SFX - some SFX have "Pay Fate to activate" as a requirement. You don't have to pay Fate for SFX that don't explicitly state that you need to!
- Use an additional dice in the total - use 3, 4, 5, INFINITE amount of dice in the total. Pay a Fate for each additional die!
- Activate a Hitch (When a die rolls a 1, more on it later) on my side
- Create a Temporary Asset - spend a Fate, get a d6 Asset which lasts for a scene. Can be a lucky find, a sudden friend, or just a piece of set dressing that you feel should be important for your roll (like picking up a crowbar, but wanting it to give you a bonus)
- Prolong an Assets life - spend a Fate, an Asset now lasts till the end of the session or until I nefariously disable it with a roll
- Include more Effect Dice - You can now have more than one Effect Dice! Note, that it doesn't improve your "main" effect, but rather allows you to do multiple things in one action (knock them off their feet and stab them in the face) or target multiple enemies at once
- Act when Taken Out - one Fate per action. You can only keep one die for the Total, so it's going to be tough unless you spend a fuckton of Fate
- Just have a lucky thing happen
- Add a d6 to an already made roll as you try to succeed from sheer fucking will

How do you get Fate:
- Roll Hitches and have me activate them
- Use SFX - in particular, all of your Distinctions have one that allows you to roll a d4 instead of a d8 to get a Fate
- Do heroic things, do good roleplaying, make a joke that cracks everyone up. Whatever would give you a Bennie, will give you a Fate, basically
- Take bribes from me as a GM when I tempt you with Fate to introduce more bullshity trouble for you related to yours or scenes Distinctions in exchange for more points

# Hitches

When a die rolls a 1, it's called a Hitch. You cannot use a die that hitches, not for the Total, nor for the Effect

Also, the opposing side can activate Hitches by paying Fate

For each Hitch rolled, I can:
- Create a d6 Complication/Asset
- Step up a Complication or bad Asset
- Step down an Asset

For you, the options are as follows:
- Step down a Complication
- Step up an Asset


> [!WARNING] When the dice hate you
> When you roll multiple Hitches, say 1, 1, 1, 2 on 4d6, the opposing side can activate multiple of them. In this case, however, I pay a Fate for each *"target"*, not for each Hitch
> Example from my side:

# That's it for now, folks!

While rules for specific enemy types, specific resolution mechanics and more GM-facing things are not included here, this is what you'll be working with - everything else is just a spin on those main rules. Me being me, I'll definitely tape on and off more rules if you'll like the system (there, are, like, 3 progression systems suggested in the book alone), but for now? It's all you need to know :p
