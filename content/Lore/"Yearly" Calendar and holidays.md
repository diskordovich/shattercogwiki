Due to... not really having an orbit, the main thing that brings the change of seasons are the winds. They are fickle things, however, so seasons pass in a span of ~30 days, not 90

# Holidays

## Skybloom

**Emerald morning**(7th): A powerful Aurora sweeps across the sky during the night and the morning. Water (or other drinks) steeped in the Auroras light are popular among soothsayers, mystics and youngling's rites, for it is said to have fortune-telling properties

**Last Ballast**(13th): A general clean-up day, with a tradition to give out unneeded stuff either to each other or to the sky. Gifts are common. Kids hunt for puffcrabs that love to nest in the undersides of the islands, as catching one and releasing into the sky is believed to make sure that an important thing you lose to the sky will return to you (and crabs are also pretty tasty, for those who don't care). Not condoned by adults, obviously

**Science Day/Day of Gorramer**(23rd): An opportunity to step into the laboratories of research institutes and a celebration dedicated to the Gorramer - the creator of the Anchors, and science in general

## Ironflame

**Day of the Republic** (10th) - the day the Republic was born and The Government founded. Accompanied by a military parade and a public announcement from the Governor!

**The Humming** (16th) - The hottest day of the year, accompanied by the meteorite shower at night. Everyone gets a day off due to the heat, with a lot of steam rising from the islands during the day as the overworked coolers fill the air with a gentle hum. Meteorites aren't big or dense enough to cause trouble, but still can whack one on the head quite painfully
## Rustfall

**Ashrain**(31st): A day when the ashes from the crematorium stores are released to the wind. A procession usually takes place to remember the dead and to pray for their safe passage into the afterlife with the great Sol. It's customary to drink with the dead during this day - a glass to them, a glass to you, for the passage to be in high spirits
## Splintercoil

**Frostmarket**(around 14th) This is the time when one of the Wandering Flotillas arrives to Republic, carrying with it untold amounts of peculiar goods and even more peculiar stories. Markets bustle, overflowing with wares and a duelling competition is held at the deck of the largest ship

**Icecrack** (23rd) Largest blizzard of the cycle arrives somewhere during this day. Large snowcatching kites are put up to catch enough water for the next cycle. Blizzard often brings curious pieces of foreign plants with it, so snowdigging is common with those that have nothing better to do (frostberries are particularly tasty, too)
